## Overview

* Create a new React-based rendition of the New York Times Article Search application. 
* Created React components, worked with helper/util functions, and utilize the React mounting lifecycle to query and display articles based on the users searches. 
* Also used Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save articles to read later.
